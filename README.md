## Understanding Complexity

Learn the principles of analyzing your code's time and space complexity using the industry-standard Big O notation. Understanding complexity is crucial for writing efficient and scalable algorithms.

## Recursion

Dive into the ins and outs of recursion, a powerful and often-used technique in programming. Master the art of solving problems through recursive solutions.

## Problem-Solving Approach

Develop a structured 5-step approach to tackle even the most challenging coding problems. This method will equip you with the skills to break down complex issues into manageable steps.

## Programming Patterns

Discover common programming patterns that simplify the process of solving complex problems. Recognizing these patterns can help you write more efficient code.

## Searching Algorithms

Implement popular searching algorithms to efficiently find elements in datasets. From linear search to binary search, we've got you covered.

## Sorting Algorithms

Explore and implement six different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Radix Sort. Learn their strengths and weaknesses and when to use each.

## Data Structures from Scratch

Switch gears and implement your own data structures from scratch. We cover linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs. Understanding these fundamental data structures is essential for a deep grasp of computer science.

## Tree and Graph Traversal

Learn to traverse trees and graphs efficiently. Traversal is a fundamental operation when working with hierarchical data structures.

## Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

Dive into graph theory and understand Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm. This algorithm is critical for solving problems related to finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.

## Dynamic Programming

The repository includes an entire section devoted to Dynamic Programming. Master this problem-solving technique that's essential for tackling a wide range of complex algorithmic problems.
